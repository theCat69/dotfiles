# cache-ctrl

A CLI tool and native opencode plugin that manages the two AI agent caches (`.ai/external-context-gatherer_cache/` and `.ai/local-context-gatherer_cache/`) with a uniform interface.

It handles advisory locking for safe concurrent writes, keyword search across all entries, HTTP freshness checking for external URLs, and file-change detection for local scans.

---

## Installation

Run from inside the `cache-ctrl/` directory:

```zsh
zsh install.sh
```

This creates two symlinks:
- `~/.local/bin/cache-ctrl` → `src/index.ts` — global CLI command (executed directly by Bun)
- `.opencode/tools/cache-ctrl.ts` → `cache_ctrl.ts` — auto-discovered by opencode as a native plugin

**Prerequisites**: `bun` must be in `PATH`. `~/.local/bin` must be in your `PATH` (it is by default on this setup).

---

```

**Key design decisions:**
- All commands funnel through `cacheManager` for reads/writes — no direct filesystem access from command handlers.
- The CLI and plugin share the same command functions — no duplicated business logic.
- All operations return `Result<T, CacheError>` — nothing throws into the caller.
- `writeCache` defaults to merging updates onto the existing object (preserving unknown agent fields). Local writes use per-path merge — submitted `tracked_files` entries replace existing entries for those paths; entries for other paths are preserved; entries for files no longer present on disk are evicted automatically.

---

## CLI Reference

**Output format**: JSON (single line) by default. Add `--pretty` to any command for indented output.  
**Errors**: Written to stderr as `{ "ok": false, "error": "...", "code": "..." }`. Exit code `1` on error, `2` on bad arguments.  
**Help**: Run `cache-ctrl --help` or `cache-ctrl help` for the full command reference. Run `cache-ctrl help <command>` for per-command usage, arguments, and options. Help output is plain text written to stdout; exit code `0` on success, `1` for unknown command.

---

### `help`

```
cache-ctrl help [<command>]
cache-ctrl --help
```

Prints human-readable usage information and exits. No JSON output.

- `cache-ctrl --help` — print full command reference (all commands with descriptions)
- `cache-ctrl help` — same as `--help`
- `cache-ctrl help <command>` — print per-command usage, arguments, and options
- `cache-ctrl help help` — same as `cache-ctrl help` (full reference)

Exit code: `0` on success, `1` if `<command>` is not recognized.

---

### `list`

```
cache-ctrl list [--agent external|local|all] [--pretty]
```

Lists all cache entries. Shows age, human-readable age string, and staleness flag.

- External entries are stale if `fetched_at` is empty or older than 24 hours.
- Local entries show `is_stale: true` only when `cache_ctrl_check_files` detects actual changes (changed files, new non-ignored files, or deleted files). A freshly-written cache with no subsequent file changes shows `is_stale: false`.

**Default**: `--agent all`

```jsonc
// cache-ctrl list --pretty
{
  "ok": true,
  "value": [
    {
      "file": "/path/to/.ai/external-context-gatherer_cache/opencode-skills.json",
      "agent": "external",
      "subject": "opencode-skills",
      "description": "opencode skill file index",
      "fetched_at": "2026-04-04T10:00:00Z",
      "age_human": "2 hours ago",
      "is_stale": false
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### `inspect`

```
cache-ctrl inspect <agent> <subject-keyword> [--filter <kw>[,<kw>...]] [--pretty]
```

Prints the full JSON content of the best-matching cache entry. Uses the same keyword scoring as `search`. Returns `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH` if two results score identically.

**`--filter <kw>[,<kw>...]`** (local agent only): restricts `facts` to entries whose file path contains at least one keyword (case-insensitive substring). `global_facts` and all other metadata fields are always included regardless of filter. Ignored for the external agent.

**`tracked_files` is never returned** for `agent: "local"` — it is internal operational metadata consumed by `check-files` and is always stripped from inspect responses.

```
cache-ctrl inspect external opencode-skills --pretty
cache-ctrl inspect local context --pretty
cache-ctrl inspect local context --filter lsp,nvim --pretty
```

---

### `flush`

```
cache-ctrl flush <agent|all> --confirm [--pretty]
```

Deletes cache files. The `--confirm` flag is **required** as a safeguard.

- `external` → deletes all `*.json` files in the external cache directory (not `.lock` files)
- `local` → deletes `context.json`
- `all` → both

```
cache-ctrl flush external --confirm
cache-ctrl flush all --confirm --pretty
```

---

### `invalidate`

```
cache-ctrl invalidate <agent> [subject-keyword] [--pretty]
```

Zeros out the timestamp (`fetched_at` for external, `timestamp` for local), marking the entry as stale without deleting its content. Agents will treat it as a cache miss on next run.

- With a keyword: invalidates the best-matching file.
- Without a keyword on `external`: invalidates **all** external entries.
- Without a keyword on `local`: invalidates `context.json`.

> If the local cache file does not exist, returns `FILE_NOT_FOUND` — the command is a no-op in that case.

```
cache-ctrl invalidate external opencode-skills
cache-ctrl invalidate external          # all external entries
cache-ctrl invalidate local
```

---

### `touch`

```
cache-ctrl touch <agent> [subject-keyword] [--pretty]
```

Resets the timestamp to the current UTC time — the inverse of `invalidate`. Marks the entry as fresh.

- Without a keyword on `external`: touches **all** external entries.

```
cache-ctrl touch external opencode-skills
cache-ctrl touch local
```

---

### `prune`

```
cache-ctrl prune [--agent external|local|all] [--max-age <duration>] [--delete] [--pretty]
```

Finds entries older than `--max-age` and invalidates them (default) or deletes them (`--delete`).

**Duration format**: `<number><unit>` — `h` for hours, `d` for days. Examples: `24h`, `7d`, `1d`.

**Defaults**: `--agent all`, `--max-age 24h` for external. Local cache **always** matches (no TTL).

> If the local cache does not exist and `--delete` is not set, the local entry is skipped silently (not added to `matched`).

> ⚠️ `prune --agent all --delete` will **always** delete the local cache. Use `--agent external` to avoid this.

```
cache-ctrl prune --agent external --max-age 7d
cache-ctrl prune --agent external --max-age 1d --delete
```

---

### `check-freshness`

```
cache-ctrl check-freshness <subject-keyword> [--url <url>] [--pretty]
```

Sends HTTP HEAD requests to each URL in the matched external entry's `sources[]`. Uses conditional headers (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`) from stored `header_metadata`. Updates `header_metadata` in-place after checking.

- HTTP 304 → `fresh`
- HTTP 200 → `stale` (resource changed)
- Network / 4xx / 5xx → `error` (does not update metadata for that URL)

With `--url`: checks only that specific URL (must exist in `sources[]`).

```jsonc
// cache-ctrl check-freshness opencode-skills --pretty
{
  "ok": true,
  "value": {
    "subject": "opencode-skills",
    "sources": [
      { "url": "https://example.com/docs", "status": "fresh", "http_status": 304 }
    ],
    "overall": "fresh"
  }
}
```

---

### `check-files`

```
cache-ctrl check-files [--pretty]
```

Reads `tracked_files[]` from the local cache and compares each file's current `mtime` (and `hash` if stored) against the saved values.

**Comparison logic:**
1. Read current `mtime` via `lstat()` (reflects the symlink node itself, not the target).
2. If stored `hash` is present and `mtime` changed → recompute SHA-256. Hash match → `unchanged` (touch-only). Hash differs → `changed`.
3. No stored `hash` → mtime change alone marks the file as `changed`.
4. File missing on disk → `missing`.

If `tracked_files` is absent or empty → returns `{ status: "unchanged", ... }` (not an error).

```jsonc
// cache-ctrl check-files --pretty
{
  "ok": true,
  "value": {
    "status": "unchanged",
    "changed_files": [],
    "unchanged_files": ["lua/plugins/ui/bufferline.lua"],
    "missing_files": []
  }
}
```

---

### `search`

```
cache-ctrl search <keyword> [<keyword>...] [--pretty]
```

Searches all cache files across both namespaces. Case-insensitive. Returns results ranked by score (descending).

**Scoring matrix** (per keyword, additive across multiple keywords):

| Match type | Score |
|---|---|
| Exact match on file stem | 100 |
| Substring match on file stem | 80 |
| Exact word match on `subject`/`topic` | 70 |
| Substring match on `subject`/`topic` | 50 |
| Keyword match on `description` | 30 |

```
cache-ctrl search opencode skills
cache-ctrl search neovim --pretty
```

---

### `write`

```
cache-ctrl write external <subject> --data '<json>' [--pretty]
cache-ctrl write local --data '<json>' [--pretty]
```

Writes a validated cache entry to disk. The `--data` argument must be a valid JSON string matching the ExternalCacheFile or LocalCacheFile schema. Schema validation runs first — all required fields must be present in `--data` or the write is rejected with `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

- `external`: `subject` is required as a positional argument. After validation, unknown fields from the existing file on disk are preserved (merge write).
- `local`: no subject argument; `timestamp` is **auto-set** to the current UTC time server-side — any value supplied in `--data` is silently overridden. `mtime` for each entry in `tracked_files[]` is **auto-populated** by the write command via filesystem `lstat()` — agents do not need to supply it. Local writes use per-path merge: submitted `tracked_files` entries replace existing entries for the same path; entries for other paths are preserved; entries for files deleted from disk are evicted automatically. On cold start (no existing cache), submit all relevant files for a full write; on subsequent writes, submit only new or changed files.
- `local`: facts paths are validated against submitted `tracked_files` — submitting a facts key outside that set returns `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

> The `subject` parameter (external agent) must match `/^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$/` and be at most 128 characters. Returns `INVALID_ARGS` if it fails validation.

**Always use this command (or `cache_ctrl_write`) instead of writing cache files directly.** Direct writes skip schema validation and risk corrupting the cache.

```json
// cache-ctrl write external mysubject --data '{"subject":"mysubject","description":"...","fetched_at":"2026-04-05T10:00:00Z","sources":[],"header_metadata":{}}' --pretty
{ "ok": true, "value": { "file": "/path/to/.ai/external-context-gatherer_cache/mysubject.json" } }
```

## opencode Plugin Tools

The plugin (`cache_ctrl.ts`) is auto-discovered via `~/.config/opencode/tools/cache_ctrl.ts` and registers 7 tools that call the same command functions as the CLI:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `cache_ctrl_search` | Search all cache entries by keyword |
| `cache_ctrl_list` | List entries with age and staleness flags |
| `cache_ctrl_inspect` | Return full content of a specific entry |
| `cache_ctrl_invalidate` | Zero out a cache entry's timestamp |
| `cache_ctrl_check_freshness` | HTTP HEAD check for external source URLs |
| `cache_ctrl_check_files` | Compare tracked files against stored mtime/hash |
| `cache_ctrl_write` | Write a validated cache entry; validates against ExternalCacheFile or LocalCacheFile schema |

No bash permission is required for agents that use the plugin tools directly.

All 7 plugin tool responses include a `server_time` field at the outer JSON level:

```json
{ "ok": true, "value": { ... }, "server_time": "2026-04-05T12:34:56.789Z" }
```

Use `server_time` to assess how stale stored timestamps are without requiring bash or system access.

## Agent Integration

### `external-context-gatherer`

```zsh
# Before fetching — check if cache is still fresh
cache-ctrl list --agent external --pretty
# If is_stale: false → skip fetch

# For a precise HTTP freshness check on a borderline entry
cache-ctrl check-freshness <subject>
# If overall: "fresh" → skip re-fetch

# After writing new cache content — mark entry fresh
cache-ctrl touch external <subject>

# Force a re-fetch
cache-ctrl invalidate external <subject>
```

### `local-context-gatherer`

```zsh
# Before deciding whether to re-scan
cache-ctrl check-files
# If status: "changed" → invalidate and re-scan
cache-ctrl invalidate local
# If status: "unchanged" → use cached context
```

**Requirement**: The agent MUST populate `tracked_files[]` (with `path` and optionally `hash`) when writing its cache file. `mtime` per entry is auto-populated server-side via filesystem `lstat()` — agents do not need to supply it. `check-files` returns `unchanged` silently if `tracked_files` is absent.

---

## Cache File Schemas

### External: `.ai/external-context-gatherer_cache/<subject>.json`

```jsonc
{
  "subject": "opencode-skills",          // Must match the file stem
  "description": "opencode skill index", // One-liner for keyword search
  "fetched_at": "2026-04-04T12:00:00Z", // "" when invalidated
  "sources": [
    { "type": "github_api", "url": "https://..." }
  ],
  "header_metadata": {
    "https://...": {
      "etag": "\"abc123\"",
      "last_modified": "Fri, 04 Apr 2026 10:00:00 GMT",
      "checked_at": "2026-04-04T12:00:00Z",
      "status": "fresh"
    }
  }
  // Any additional agent fields are preserved unchanged
}
```

### Local: `.ai/local-context-gatherer_cache/context.json`

> `timestamp` is **auto-set** by the write command to the current UTC time. Do not include it in agent-supplied content — any value provided is silently overridden. `mtime` values in `tracked_files[]` are **auto-populated** by the write command via filesystem `lstat()` — agents only need to supply `path` (and optionally `hash`). Local writes use per-path merge: submitted `tracked_files` entries replace existing entries for the same path; entries for other paths are preserved; entries for files deleted from disk are evicted automatically. On cold start (no existing cache), submit all relevant files; on subsequent writes, submit only new or changed files.

```jsonc
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-04T12:00:00Z",   // auto-set on write; "" when invalidated
  "topic": "neovim plugin configuration",
  "description": "Scan of nvim lua plugins",
  "cache_miss_reason": "files changed",  // optional: why the previous cache was discarded
  "tracked_files": [
    { "path": "lua/plugins/ui/bufferline.lua", "mtime": 1743768000000, "hash": "sha256hex..." }
    // mtime is auto-populated by the write command; agents only need to supply path (and optionally hash)
  ],
  "global_facts": [                       // optional: repo-level facts; last-write-wins
    "Kubuntu dotfiles repo",
    "StyLua for Lua (140 col, 2-space indent)"
  ],
  "facts": {                              // optional: per-file facts; per-path merge
    "lua/plugins/ui/bufferline.lua": ["lazy-loaded via ft = lua", "uses catppuccin mocha theme"]
    // Facts for files deleted from disk are evicted automatically on the next write
  }
  // Any additional agent fields are preserved unchanged
}
```

## Development

```zsh
# Run unit tests
bun run test

# Watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Run E2E tests (requires Docker)
bun run test:e2e

# Re-run installer (idempotent)
zsh install.sh
```

Unit tests live in `tests/` and use Vitest. Filesystem operations use real temp directories; HTTP calls are mocked with `vi.mock`.

E2E tests live in `e2e/tests/` and run inside Docker via `docker compose -f e2e/docker-compose.yml run --rm e2e`. They spawn the actual CLI binary as a subprocess and verify exit codes, stdout/stderr JSON shape, and cross-command behaviour. Docker must be running; no other host dependencies are required.
